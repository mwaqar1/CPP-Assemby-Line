# C++ Assembly Line Simulation Project

## Project Overview
Developed a complex C++ application simulating an assembly line using object-oriented programming principles, which involved managing workstations and customer orders across multiple stages, ensuring a robust system that handles dynamic order processing.

## Technical Proficiencies
Demonstrated advanced proficiency in C++, STL algorithms, and object-oriented design patterns. Utilized dynamic memory management, exception handling, and file I/O operations to simulate real-world manufacturing processes.

## Key Achievements
- **Utilities and Station Modules:** Implemented modules to parse configuration files and manage individual workstation data, integrating robust string manipulation techniques to maintain system integrity and optimize data processing.
- **CustomerOrder Module:** Designed and developed a critical component handling dynamic allocation of customer orders, significantly enhancing the system's capability to manage varying order sizes and complexities without memory leaks or faults.
- **LineManager Module:** Orchestrated the complete assembly line using custom STL algorithms and lambda functions, enabling efficient order processing through interconnected workstations without manual iteration loops.

## Problem Solving and Innovation
- Engineered a solution to dynamically link stations based on external configuration, reducing hardcoded dependencies and enhancing the systemâ€™s flexibility and scalability.
- Addressed complex memory management challenges by implementing sophisticated mechanisms for memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring high reliability and performance of the system.
- Overcame ambiguities in project specifications by reverse-engineering provided code samples and engaging in proactive problem-solving, demonstrating high adaptability and analytical skills.

## Outcomes
Successfully delivered a fully functional assembly line simulation as per the project specifications, achieving a comprehensive understanding of advanced C++ features and deepening insights into practical software engineering challenges.
